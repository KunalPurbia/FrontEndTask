# FrontEndTask

Given an api of posts and comments (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), create the following routes: 
   i) Route to show all posts, each post should like to it's single view page
   ii) Route to view a single post
   iii) On single post page, load comments related to that particular post and show them under the post
   iv) Show loading when the data is loading or data fetch is in process
   v) Show no results found when there are no products are matching the search criteria
Note: use React Hooks and functional components to achieve the same
