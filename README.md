# FrontEndTask

<br/> Given an api of posts and comments (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), create the following routes: 
<br/>   i) Route to show all posts, each post should like to it's single view page
<br/>   ii) Route to view a single post
<br/>   iii) On single post page, load comments related to that particular post and show them under the post
<br/>   iv) Show loading when the data is loading or data fetch is in process
<br/>   v) Show no results found when there are no products are matching the search criteria
<br/> Note: use React Hooks and functional components to achieve the same
